        "LambdaMart is a learning to rank algorithm which is a combination of LambdaRank and MART. The LambdaMart algorithm considers a pair of items (query, documents) at any given time and then comes up with a suitable ordering of those items before initiating the final order of the entire list. MART stands for Multiple Additive Regression Tress that is basically many decision trees added together and is combined with an ML technique called Gradient Boosting where a model is formed that is a weighted combination of an ensemble of “weak learners”. Here, each “weak learner” is a decision tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, MART is a framework for finding an ensemble of trees that, when added together, minimizes a loss function. But, to this framework, gradients of the loss function must be fed at each training point. This is where the “Lambda” part of LambdaMART comes into the picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "In ranking, optimising the loss function such as NDCG or MAP is key. But, these loss functions aren’t differentiable at all points, so they can’t used directly in the Gradient Boosting. Hence, a lambda gradient is derived which is analogous to those that have been defined for NDCG or MAP.\n",
        "\n",
        "LambdaMART uses the idea from a previous model called LambdaRank. For every training point pair a lambda gradient is calculated. This gradient can be thought of as the factor that moves the documents up and down a ranked list. These lambda gradients are used for optimising loss functions such as NDCG, MAP and MRR.\n",

        "Listwise approach aims to optimise evaluation metrics like NDCG and MAP. In this, each ranking list of documents for a query is treated as training instance.
